The authors use a measurement of street-network disconnectedness (SNDi) to assess changes in urban street networks in countries worldwide between 1975 and 2014. They find that sprawl (higher SNDi and thus more disconnected streets) has increased in cities across the globe over the last four decades. Higher-income countries (except Japan) had higher rates of sprawl until the last 20 years, when developments have become somewhat more connected. Middle- and low-income countries have generally maintained similar rates of street-network connectedness, with the exception of cities in Latin America, which have grown more sprawling over the last four decades. Of all the types of street networks, the irregular grid has seen the steepest decline, while circuitous networks (typical of culs-de-sac) have grown rapidly. This finding doesn't surprise me, given that cities are still oriented around car transportation, and that residents of wealthier countries are more likely to own cars. Given the "persistence" factor that they mention, it seems like some cities are locked into intensifying sprawl, especially in countries with a growing middle-class and high demand for new development.

Two questions: 
  1. You mentioned that the irregular grid has seen the steepest decline in street-network types. To what do you attribute this decline?
  2. How well does this account for street networks in informal settlements? I know you're dependent on OpenStreetMap, and I haven't explored it much, but I assume   that informal settlements are highly connected but not easy to map.
