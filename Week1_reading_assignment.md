The article I found is called "Mapping COVID-19: How web-based maps contribute to the infodemic," by Peter Mooney and Levente Juh√°sz, published in Dialogues in Human Geography. The authors are interested in how web-based maps were used to display information about the spread of covid-19 in the first few months of the pandemic. They argue that the proliferation of these maps contributed to an "infodemic"--an overabundance of information--in the beginning of the pandemic. In their analysis, these maps always suffered from a flaw in design or presentation, or misrepresented underlying public health data. The abundance and ease of use of these maps could have exacerbated the spread of misinformation, and led an under-informed public to make assumptions about the spread of the disease that were based less on quality public health data and more on the geographic representation of that data. The authors urge caution in the use of web-based maps, and propose that government officials, geographers, spatial data scientists, and data journalists to develop guidelines for communicating with web-based maps.

This article brought up important questions about the use of maps during the initial months of the covid-19 epidemic, and about the role of data scientists and cartographers in conveying public health information. In mid-March, state and local governments and news media quickly developed maps showing the spread of the virus across the United States. Some of these maps were better than others, and there was little consistency or clarity across platforms about which data to present, how to present them, and the level of digital literacy assumed among readers. For example, most Covid-19 maps of the United States display states in various shades of color corresponding to the number of infections. These maps require the reader to have a certain level of knowledge to use them effectively. The reader has to know, for example, what metric the mapmaker is using to convey severity of Covid-19 cases, and that metric is appropriate. Are states shaded based on number of total cases? Number of cases relative to population? Number of deaths? Without clear guidelines of what the map is showing or how to interpret it, the mapmaker relies on the hope that their reader is data-literate. The maps also may not be presenting information that is useful for individual decision-making. What does the shade of a state tell us about the safety of visiting it? Does the risk of driving through Los Angeles County at a low rate of infection really differ from driving through Arizona with a high rate of infection? These maps might implicitly warn people to stay away from certain places, even though they say very little about the likelihood of catching the virus in a given place. Coming into this class, I want to be conscious of what information a map is conveying and what assumptions it makes of its readers. Mapmakers should be clear about what information they are conveying and how they intend it to be interpreted.
