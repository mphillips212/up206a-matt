I read Geoff Boeing's article on OSMnx in Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems. I don't have a background in urban data science or street network analysis, so this article was all new for me. OSMnx sounds like a really useful tool, and I'm excited to learn how I can use it for my research interests. One line that grabbed my attention was in section 3.2, when the author lists specific network types. He explains six different types of networks that we can access through OSMnx: drivable public streets, streets including service roads, streets that pedestrians can use, streets for biking, all non-private streets, and all private streets and paths. I am curious what source OSMnx pulls from to determine these different types of networks. How does it classify which streets are pedestrian-friendly? Having lived in cities almost my entire life, I know there are some areas that I consider pedestrian friendly that may not technically have a sidewalk. How does OSMnx account for "unofficial" paths that people might use regularly?
